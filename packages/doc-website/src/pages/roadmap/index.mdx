## Guiding Principles

We aim to preserve these goals and values for the life of this project.

#### Easy integration
* No special configuration files required to get started
* Simple, straightforward package structure
* Anti-lock-in philosophy: No complexity for the sake of user retention
#### Parity between the CLI and API
* What is possible with the CLI should be possible with the API, and vice versa, with minimal exception
#### Thorough documentation
* All functionality accounted for in this website
* Intellisense for all API features
* CLI usage/help documentation for all commands
#### Aggressive defense against regression
* Features aren't added without test additions
* Bugs aren't fixed without test additions
#### Core features remain free
* No artificial paywalls for the local features of the package

## Short Term Goals

#### An "affected workspaces" feature
  * This refers to the ability to detect which workspaces are affected by code changes
  * This feature will likely be released as experimental
  * The workspace dependency graph will be used to determine which workspaces are implicitly affected by another's change
  * It should be possible to pass git refs as the basis of comparison for changes or a simple list of files
## Medium/Long Term Goals
#### A type generation feature
  * The ability to generate TypeScript types specific to your project, similar to [Chakra UI's](https://www.chakra-ui.com/docs/get-started/cli#chakra-typegen) typegen feature, such as for workspace and script names
#### A local cache
  * The ability to cache the outputs of scripts based on given inputs, for performance
